"""Cloud needs-attention poller for OpenAdapt Tray.

Polls the hosted control plane for the number of automations that need
attention and surfaces it as a tray badge + a desktop notification when the
count rises. Authenticated with the ingest bearer token from the OS keychain.

Contract (spec §3c) — the exact request this module issues::

    GET {hosted_url}/api/needs-attention/count
    Authorization: Bearer <ingest token>
    → 200 { "count": <int>, "halts": <int>, "uncertain_dispatches": <int> }

Click routing is lane-aware:
  * cloud lane → open ``{hosted_url}/dashboard`` in the browser
  * byoc lane  → IPC ``open_teach`` to the desktop (the fix stays local)
